# Gateway Tests

Ruby [Bummr](https://github.com/lpender/bummr) requires a comprehensive test
suite to safely update application dependencies.

The existing Gateway test suite does not catch all error created by
dependencies upgrades.

The tests included in this sub-project will include API requests
and automated Puppeteer website tests.
